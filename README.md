# TODO App
## 📱 About the App
This is a Todo app created using React Native that allows users to manage their tasks and keep track of their progress. The app uses the concept of states and props to update the UI in real-time based on user interactions. It also utilizes various components such as StatusBar, TouchableOpacity, and KeyboardAvoidingView to enhance the user experience. The app is styled to give it an appealing and modern look.

## 📜 Components Used
- #### StatusBar:
     It is a component that allows users to customize the status bar at the top of their device's screen. It can be used to change the background color, text color, and other settings of the status bar.

- #### TouchableOpacity: 
    This component provides touchable feedback to the user when a button is pressed. It can be used to perform various actions such as navigation, data submission, and more.

- #### KeyboardAvoidingView:
     This component helps to avoid the keyboard overlapping with the text inputs. It automatically adjusts the UI based on the position of the keyboard, making it easier for users to enter their data.

## 📝 Splice Method
The app also uses the splice method to update the state of the task list. This method allows users to remove or add items to the task list based on their interactions. It is a powerful method that can be used to modify the contents of an array without changing its length.

## 🎨 Styling
The app is styled using a combination of custom CSS and React Native's built-in styling properties. The colors used are vibrant and appealing to the eye, making it easy for users to identify different elements in the UI.
